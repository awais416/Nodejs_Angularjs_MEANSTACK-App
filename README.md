## Summary
This project is a MEANSTACK project which uses all sorts of javascript frameworks like angular.js, node.js, express. I also used jade as
the html engine, stylus as the CSS preprocesssor, mongodb via mongoose as a NO SQL, and Mocha for testing. This app is in progress and i will
continue to develop this to make it better and add more features.
